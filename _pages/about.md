Yamen Ajjour is interested in tackling subjectivity in natural language processing. This includes
1. Developing methods that generalize to unseen subjective tasks.
2. Conversational Data Annotation: developing methods to explain and disambiguate annotations in subjective tasks.

My PhD Thesis was on *Addressing Controversial Topics in Search Engines* where I worked on 

1. Identifying argumentative questions 
2. Genre-robust argument unit segmentation and topic bias in argument corpora
3. Identifying and visualizing frames in Argumentation
