The main reason is the gap confronted by citizens between the internet culture (e.g., Netflix) and the bureaucratic processes enforced by existing governments. The transformation to an AI-based government should be accomplished by realizing twelve layers. The twelve layers are divided into:</p> <ul> <li>Six implementation layers that represent different sectors: <ul> <li>User Interface transform from fragmented portals into centralized, personalized, and multimodal agents.</li> <li>Workflows transform from hand-crafted compliance-first processes to workflows that are dynamically generated by AI-agents to meet a predefined outcome (e.g., A permit agent might be tasked with approving 90% of construction applications within ten days while rigorously enforcing zoning and climate standards)</li> <li>Policy and law making transform from being deliberative and static to adaptive and simulation-based.
